Chrome extension for GhostPost (Sina Weibo deleted post recovery)

GhostPost is a system for preserving deleted Sina Weibo posts. 

GhostPost comes as a Chrome extension, and monitors the Weibo users you follow, 
watching for disappearing posts. When it realizes a post has been deleted, 
it reports it to the system. At the same time, while you're browsing Weibo, 
the extension queries the system to learn of any deleted posts that were posted 
by users you follow. If there are any, GhostPost seamlessly inserts them back 
into the weibo.com HTML where they should have been (and with an indication 
that they were deleted).
