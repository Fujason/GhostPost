# SHUTDOWN

On July 21, 2017, the GhostPost server that has been running at salmon.cs.illinois.edu will shut down. GhostPost could run on any HTTPS server, but I won't have the time in the near-to-moderate term to maintain it. If you would like to take over<sup>1</sup>, please contact me! The Chrome extension client will need to be rebuilt with the new URL, and redistributed. Other than that, no changes are needed.

(1) Concerned users: I will investigate any interested group thoroughly, and require references from trustworthy third parties, to be sure the censor isn't getting involved.

Chrome extension for GhostPost (Sina Weibo deleted post recovery)

GhostPost is a system for preserving deleted Sina Weibo posts. 

GhostPost comes as a Chrome extension, and monitors the Weibo users you follow, 
watching for disappearing posts. When it realizes a post has been deleted, 
it reports it to the system. At the same time, while you're browsing Weibo, 
the extension queries the system to learn of any deleted posts that were posted 
by users you follow. If there are any, GhostPost seamlessly inserts them back 
into the weibo.com HTML where they should have been (and with an indication 
that they were deleted).
